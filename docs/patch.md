## Python Patch Script

The `patch.py` file should be a Python script that contains definitions for custom methods. These methods are intended to be added to OMERO gateway wrapper classes to extend their functionality. This is commonly known as "monkey patching".

Here's a basic outline of how you can structure your `patch.py`:

```python
def getROIs(self):
    # This is just a placeholder. Replace the code here with whatever functionality.
    pass

def getOtherAttributes(self):
    # Another placeholder function. Add your code here.
    pass

# Assign the new methods to the relevant OMERO classes
import omero.gateway
omero.gateway.ImageWrapper.getROIs = getROIs
omero.gateway.ImageWrapper.getOtherAttributes = getOtherAttributes
```

In the script above, we define two methods: `getROIs()` and `getOtherAttributes()`. Each of these methods should only accept `self` as a parameter, meaning they are instance methods.

We then assign these methods to the `ImageWrapper` class of the `omero.gateway` module, thereby extending the functionality of this class. When instances of this class are used within the OMERO.AutoTagger application, they will now have access to these additional methods.

Ensure your patch script is tailored to your requirements and correctly interfaces with the existing OMERO objects you are working with.
